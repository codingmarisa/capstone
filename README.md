# \<Adventure Game\>

## Description
OSU Capstone Project - Winter 2019

\<Adventure Game\> is a video game adventure that pulls inspiration from many different games such as Zelda, Pokemon, and Mario Bros. It is written in C++ and playable in a Linux environment. The user is able to control a playable character while navigating a 2-D world via a top-down or side-scroller view. Interactive windows allow the user to switch between world navigation and inventory. Windows are also used to display important stats such as health and the currently equipped item, as well as display important narrative information such as the room descriptions, item descriptions, or events that occur.
